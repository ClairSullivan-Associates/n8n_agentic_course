# Instructions

There are two major sections to this module's challenges: access the Bill.com v3 API for workflows and extracting information from PDFs and webpages.

# Bill.com v3 API Instructions

You will be provided during class with the credentials to access a Bill Sandbox account that has data preloaded into it.  Using the v3 API and any n8n nodes you need, your task will be to create an agent that answers the following questions.

**Important Note:**
You will use the following URL to access the API: `https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/login` 


## Question 1

Within the Sandbox you will find a vendor named "San Jose Music Supplies."  You will need to determine how much money they owe this organization as well as how late their required payments are.  Using this information, construct an email to them reminding them of their outstanding balance and requesting payment.  Use language that is appropriate to how late their payments are.  Copy and paste the text of the email into the scorer when you are completed.

## Question 2

Also within the Sandbox is the vendor named "Green Thumb Landscaping" that has some outstanding payments.  Construct an email to them reminding them of their outstanding balance and requesting payment. Use language that is appropriate to how late their payments are.  Copy and paste the text of the email into the scorer when you are completed.

## Question 3

You are the accountant for this simulated organization and have to provide a summary of the outstanding balances due to the organization.  Obtain this information and use it to craft an email to your boss with this information.  Copy and paste the text of the email into the scorer when you are completed.

## Question 4

Based on the data in the Sandbox, forecast potential cash flow issues based on increasing overdue trends and recommend actions such as changes to payment terms or prioritization of collections.  Copy and paste the text of this forecast into the scorer when you are completed.

## Question 5

Create a Google Sheet with complete details on all invoices in the system, including:

- Vendor Name
- Vendor ID
- Invoice amount
- Number of days late (assume today's date is 2025-04-10 for this exercise) 

Copy and paste the results of the Google Sheet into the scorer when you are completed.
