Token-based sign in
❗️
IMPORTANT

This section is about the token-based sign in process for working with the BILL v3 API. See Authentication with Spend & Expense API token for information about getting a BILL Spend & Expense API token.

When you sign in to your BILL developer account with user credentials (userName, password, orgId, and devKey), the generated sessionId enables you to call any BILL API endpoint without restrictions. This sessionId expires when it is inactive or idle for 35 minutes and you are automatically signed out.

You can also sign in to your BILL developer account with a user-generated token. The generated sessionId expires when it is inactive or idle for 48 hours, and provides limited access to the BILL API.

Generate a token
You can generate a token with the BILL sandbox web app.

Sign in to the BILL sandbox web app. Use the email address and password you created as part of the sign-up process.
Click Settings in your BILL account.
Click Sync & Integrations > Tokens.
Click NEW to create a new sync token.
Enter a NAME and click SAVE. The name is your userName for signing in with /v3/login.
A new token is generated. This token is your password for signing in with /v3/login.

Sign in with a token
In this cURL example, you sign in to your API sandbox developer account with /v3/login. The required fields are userName, password, orgId, and devKey.

Sign-in credentials	Description
userName	Your username is the name that you set up for creating your token.
password	Your password is the generated token.
orgId	Your organization ID. You can retrieve this value with /ListOrgs.json.
devKey	Your developer key (sent to you when you create a developer account).
Sign in with /Login.json

curl --request POST \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/login' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--data 'userName={token_name}' \
--data 'password={token_value}' \
--data 'orgId={organization_id}' \
--data 'devKey={developer_key}'
In the response, the generated sessionId is available. This sessionId expires when it is inactive or idle for 48 hours.

Identity verification
As part of adding your bank account in production, you are required to follow an identity verification process. See Verify your identity in the BILL Help Center for more information.

API rate limits
For uninterrupted access to BILL API services, follow the API rate limit rules and use exponential backoff to space out your API requests.

What is an API rate limit?
An API rate limit is the number of API requests your solution or users can make within a given time period.

Limit	Description
API rate limit	The number of API requests per developer key per hour
API concurrent rate limit	The number of simultaneous API requests per developer key per organization
BILL API rate limits
The rate limit for BILL API requests per developer key per hour is 20000. When you reach this limit, you receive the BDC_1144 error. All subsequent API requests must wait until the beginning of the next hour.

BDC_1144 error

[
    {
        "timestamp": "2025-12-25T00:00:00.000+00:00",
        "code": "BDC_1144",
        "severity": "ERROR",
        "category": "DOWNSTREAM",
        "message": "Max number of allowed requests per hour reached: 20000."
    }
]
❗️
IMPORTANT

There are special cases for the BILL API rate limits. The API login (POST /v3/login) rate limit is 200 per developer key per hour.

For all endpoints that result in a text or email messages being sent to a user, the messages are sent at a rate of 5 per minute.

Endpoints that result in a text message or email being sent to a user
API login: POST /v3/login
Generate MFA challenge: POST /v3/mfa/challenge
Send an invoice: POST /v3/invoices/{invoiceId}/email
Invite a customer in the BILL network: POST /v3/network/invitation/customer/{customerId}
Invite a vendor in the BILL network: POST /v3/network/invitation/vendor/{vendorId}
BILL API concurrent rate limits
The concurrent rate limit for BILL API requests per developer key per organization is 3.

When you reach this limit, you receive the BDC_1322 error. All subsequent API requests fail until one concurrent request is completed.

BDC_1340 error

[
    {
        "timestamp": "2025-12-25T00:00:00.000+00:00",
        "code": "BDC_1322",
        "severity": "ERROR",
        "category": "DOWNSTREAM",
        "message": "Max number of concurrent requests per organization reached."
    }
]
BILL Spend & Expense API rate limits
The BILL Spend & Expense API rate limit is 60 calls per minute.

Implement exponential backoff
Implement exponential backoff in your code and appropriately space out your API requests to avoid hitting the BILL rate limits and concurrent rate limits.

In this Python example, when you hit the BILL rate limits and receive the BDC_1144 error, the time.sleep() function is used to set a backoff in seconds before retrying the API request.

The delay in seconds is calculated as 2 ^ (number of unsuccessful retries).

📘
NOTE

In the example, max_retry is set as 12 for the maximum possible backoff time in seconds to go past one hour. For BILL rate limits, this logic ensures that all subsequent API requests wait until the beginning of the next hour.

Exponential backoff Python example

import time, requests, json

# Set your session ID & developer key
session_id = "set_your_session_id"
developer_key = "set_your_developer_key"

headers = {
  "Accept": "application/json",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "sessionId": session_id,
  "devKey": developer_key
}

max_retry = 12
retry = 0

while retry < max_retry:
  # Make a BILL API call (Get list of vendors)
  url = "https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/vendors"

  result = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
  # If not rate limited, break & continue with your code logic
  if json.loads(result.text)[0]['code'] != "BDC_1144":
    break
  else:
    # If rate limited, add exponential backoff
    time.sleep(2 ** retry)
    retry = retry + 1

Organizations and Users
In this section, we walk through understanding organizations and users at BILL.

What is an organization?
A BILL organization represents a legal entity (individual or business). When you create a BILL account, you set up a BILL organization with related information, such as your physical address, tax ID, and business category. In addition, you set up a payments funding account, such as a bank account.

Who is a user?
When you sign in to your BILL developer account with /v3/login, you sign in as a user of your BILL organization. In the API response, userId is the BILL-generated ID of the signed-in user.

❗️
IMPORTANT

A BILL partner can perform partner-level operations, which includes creating an organization, and then creating and managing users for that organization. See BILL partner operations for more information.

If you are interested in becoming a BILL partner, please reach out to your account manager for more information.

As an organization-level user, you have permissions to perform a set of BILL API operations. By default, the user that creates a BILL account has the BILL ADMINISTRATOR user role, and is able to perform all organization-level BILL API operations.

BILL provides a set of default user roles.

Administrator
Accountant
Approver
Payer
Clerk
Auditor
See User roles and permissions in the BILL Help Center to learn about BILL user roles.

Organization operations
BILL provides two organization API endpoints for organization-level users. See the /v3/organizations API for more information.

Operation	API endpoint
Get organization details	GET /v3/organizations/{organizationId}
Update an organization	PATCH /v3/organizations/{organizationId}
In addition, you can set up a bank account in your BILL organization with POST /v3/bankaccounts. See Bank account setup (v3 API) for more information.

Create a user
As a user with the ADMINISTRATOR user role in a BILL organization, you can use the BILL API to create other users and also manage user access in the BILL organization.

In your POST /v3/users request, set the required fields to create a user.

Field	Description

Bank account setup (v3 API)
Bank account setup in your BILL organization with the BILL v3 API is a three-step process.

Create a bank account with POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks.
Verify the bank account with POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}/verify.
Ensure that the bank account user is verified to use the bank account.
You can also set up a bank account with the BILL web app. See Bank account setup (BILL web app) for more information.

❗️
IMPORTANT

Creating a bank account requires an MFA-trusted API session. See MFA setup in the API reference for information about the BILL MFA process.

Bank accounts best practices
We recommend that you follow the best practices checklist when setting up bank accounts with the BILL v3 API.

Test with different account numbers: When you create a test bank account, use different test routingNumber and accountNumber combinations. Avoid using the same numbers across different test BILL organizations.
Complete bank account verification: After you create a test bank account, complete the bank account verification step. This helps with better managing your test bank accounts.
Create a bank account
In your POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks request, set the required fields.

Field	Description
nameOnAccount	Full name on bank account
routingNumber	Bank account routing number. For testing, enter any valid routing number. For example, 074000010.

In the response, three fields are set to their default values.

The bank account status is set as PENDING. You can verify the bank account with POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}/verify.
The payables and receivables values are set as false. To update these values, update the bank account with PATCH /v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}.
See the /v3/funding-accounts/banks API for more information.

Verify a bank account
In your POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}/verify request, set the required fields.

When you create a bank account, BILL sends a test ACH payment to the bank account to confirm whether the account details are accurate. Enter the test amount as the depositAmount value in your POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}/verify request.

❗️
IMPORTANT

When you create a bank account with the API in the production environment, you must complete bank account verification before the account can be used for other BILL operations.

In the sandbox environment, set depositAmount as 0.50 to complete bank account verification.

Field	Description
bankAccountId	BILL-generated ID of the bank account. The value begins with bac.
depositAmount	Verify deposit amount. Enter an amount between 0.01 and 0.99.
See the /v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}/verify API for more information.

Sample request
In this cURL example, the bank account verification is initiated. In the request, depositAmount is set as the test ACH payment sent by BILL when the bank account was created.

cURL

curl --request POST \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}/verify' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'devKey: {developer_key}' \
--header 'sessionId: {session_id}' \
--data '{
  "depositAmount": 0.50
}'
Response
In the response, the bank account verification status is available.

JSON

{
  "verified": true
}
The bank account status is set as VERIFIED when BILL is able to verify the depositAmount value. When BILL cannot verify the bank account after three attempts, you cannot use the bank account. At that point, use another bank account or create a bank account with POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks.

See the /v3/funding-accounts/banks/{bankAccountId}/verify API for more information.

Bank account user must be verified
After your bank account verification is complete, ensure that the current bank account user verificationStatus is set as VERIFIED before you can use the bank account.

Confirm the verificationStatus of the user with GET /v3/funding-accounts/banks/users. To begin the verification process for the user, nominate a bank account user with POST /v3/funding-accounts/banks/users/nominate.

When you nominate a user, BILL performs a set of operations.

The bank account user verificationStatus is set as NOMINATED.
BILL sends the user an email asking them to sign in to the BILL web app and complete identity verification.
After user identity verification is successful, the bank account user verificationStatus is set as VERIFIED and the user can pay with the specified bank account.

See the /v3/funding-accounts/banks/users/nominate API for more information.

Vendors
In this section, we walk through creating vendors and enabling payments for the created vendors.

What is a vendor?
A vendor is an organization that you pay for goods and services they provide. Vendors and customers using BILL can be connected with each other in the BILL network. Network connections between vendors and customers enable electronic payments between them.

International vendors are vendors outside the US. See Country information for international payments in the BILL Help Center to learn about supported countries and currencies.

Vendor payments
There are multiple ways in which you can set up vendors and vendor payments.

Create a vendor with address information	Create a vendor with address and bank account information	Connect with a vendor in the BILL network
When you pay the vendor, BILL enables you to send a check to the vendor.	When you pay the vendor, BILL enables you to make an electronic payment.

NOTE: Make sure that the bank account setup in your BILL organization is complete.	When the BILL network vendor accepts the invite, BILL enables you to pay the vendor.

The payment method (check or electronic payment) is based on how the network vendor is set up.

See BILL network for more information about workflows with the BILL network.
In the next set of sections, we walk through creating an example US vendor and international vendor.

Additional configuration for enabling electronic payments
In your POST/v3/vendors request, paymentPurpose and regulatoryFields are additional required fields for enabling electronic payments to international vendors (not United States) in specific countries. This information is based on vendor country, bill currency, and vendor account type.

You can get the required information with GET /v3/vendors/configuration/international-payments. See the /v3/vendors/configuration/international-payments API for more information.

👍
Get your international vendor configuration

If you are adding paymentPurpose and regulatoryFields information after creating an international vendor, use GET /v3/vendors/{vendorId}/configuration to get the required configuration for your created vendor. See the /v3/vendors/{vendorId}/configuration API for more information.

paymentPurpose
Payment purpose information for compliance with international payment rules of the vendor country. This information is based on vendor country, bill currency, and vendor account type.

The payment purpose information for international vendors must conform to a set of rules.

text or code: You must set either the text or code field for vendor payments in an international currency (not USD). You cannot set both fields.

Information source: Learn about which field to set (text or code) with GET /v3/vendors/configuration/international-payments.

Some countries do not require payment purpose: There are vendor countries, like Japan, that do not require any payment purpose information. For such countries, setting paymentPurpose in your request results in an error. This information is available with GET /v3/vendors/configuration/international-payments.

Example: Denmark
In this GET /v3/vendors/configuration/international-payments cURL example, international payments configuration is retrieved for a vendor in Denmark (DK). The bill currency is set as Euro (EUR).

        "regularExpression": "^[0-9]{6}$",
        "required": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
From the response, we learn that only the accountNumber and routingNumber fields are required for adding an Australian vendor bank account. The regularExpression field for routingNumber tells us that the field must be 6 digits and refers to the Bank-State-Branch (BSB) code in Australia.

See the /v3/vendors/configuration/international-payments API for more information.

Recurring bills
A recurring bill is a template for creating identical bills for periodic payments to a vendor. Each bill represents an amount owed for goods and services provided by the vendor.

In the recurring bill template, you can add bill line items to record details about individual goods or services. Recurring bill invoice numbers are automatically set as the bill due date in the YYYY-MM-DD format. See the /v3/recurringbills API for more information about the complete list of recurring bill operations.

Create a recurring bill
In your POST /v3/recurringbills request, set the required fields.

Field	Description
vendorId	BILL-generated ID of the vendor you want to pay. This value begins with 009.
schedule	Recurring bills scheduling information.

- period :DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, or YEARLY
- frequency: Bill frequency per time period. For example, if the time period is MONTHLY and frequency is 3, a bill is generated once every 3 months.
- nextDueDate
- endDate
- daysInAdvance: Number of days before nextDueDate when the next bill is generated. If the date has occurred in the past for one or more bills, all those bills are generated.
recurringBillLineItems	In the recurringBillLineItems array, set amount as the bill line item amount.
See the /v3/recurringbills API for more information about the other recurring bill fields you can set.

Sample request
In this cURL example, a recurring bill of $19.99 is set up for the vendor (vendorId).

The schedule is once a month for 12 months and each bill is created 5 days before the bill due date. Bank account information is added and auto-pay is enabled for each created bill.

Payments
Use POST /v3/payments to pay a vendor bill. If you make a vendor payment without creating a bill, a new bill is auto-generated at the time of payment. You can also use POST /v3/payments/bulk to pay multiple bills with one request.

When you pay a vendor, BILL sends a payment check to the vendor. To enable electronic payments, vendor bank account information and additional vendor details are required. See Vendors for more information.

See Payables payment timing in the BILL Help Center to learn about the standard BILL payment process and timing.

❗️
IMPORTANT

Creating a payment requires an MFA-trusted API session. See MFA setup in the API reference for information about the BILL MFA process.

Create a payment
In your POST /v3/payments request, set the required fields.

Field	Description
billId	BILL-generated ID of the bill to be paid. This value begins with 00n. If createBill is true, do not set billId in your payment request.
processDate	Bill payment processing date in the yyyy-MM-dd format. Funds are withdrawn from the sender's funding account on this date.

If the funding account type is set as WALLET, processDate is required. For other funding account types, if processDate is not set, the date is automatically set as the next available payment date.
fundingAccount	Funding account information.

- type (BANK_ACCOUNT, CARD_ACCOUNT, or WALLET (BILL balance))
- id: BILL-generated ID of the selected payment funding type. For the WALLET type, id is not required.
amount	Payment amount information. For a payment in an international currency (not USD), this value is in the local currency.
processingOptions	Payment processing options.

- Set createBill as false to create a vendor payment for an existing bill.
- Set createBill as true to create a bill for a vendor payment. If createBill is true, do not set billId in your payment request.
See the /v3/payments API for more information about the other payment fields you can set.

Sample request
In this cURL example, a vendor payment of $228.99 is created for the vendor (vendorId).

The billId is associated with the payment to link the payment with the bill line items and bill amount. Funding account details are added to provide a bank account source for the payment. In the example, the bank account id is retrieved with GET /v3/bankaccounts. See Get list of bank accounts in the API reference for more information.

The requestPayFaster option is set to specify that the payment is eligible for Pay Faster. See Pay bills using Pay Faster in the BILL Help Center for more information.

BILL network
In this section, we walk through a BILL network workflow for connecting with a vendor in the BILL network. When the workflow is complete, your BILL organization becomes a customer for the connected vendor and you can pay the connected vendor.

What is the BILL network?
The BILL network is a collection of vendor organizations and customer organizations using BILL. Network connections between vendors and customers enable payments between them.

Verified national vendors (Large billers) include water, power, cable, and phone companies and are part of the BILL verified national vendor network. The BILL network includes the verified national vendor network.

Operations and workflows
When you create a customer or vendor with the BILL web app, BILL automatically searches to confirm whether the created customer or vendor is in the BILL network. Search results show any records that are a complete or partial match with the name or address.

With the BILL API, you can search for and connect with a customer or vendor in the BILL network. When the connection request is accepted, BILL enables payments between the connections.

In the next set of sections, we we walk through an example BILL network workflow for connecting with a vendor in the BILL network. Follow the steps in the given order.

PENDING	Invitation is sent to the vendor in the BILL network
CONNECTED	The vendor in the BILL network has accepted the invitation. You are connected with the vendor.
CONNECTED_RPPS	Connected with a verified national vendor
In the next set of steps, after you connect with a vendor called Happy Music Supplies in the BILL network, BILL updates the created vendor called Happy with the network vendor payment information.

Search for the vendor
In this cURL example, a search request is sent for a vendor called Happy Music Supplies in the BILL network.

cURL

curl --request GET \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/network?name=Happy%20Music%20Supplies&scope=BILL' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'devKey: {developer_key}' \
--header 'sessionId: {session_id}'
In the response, the search result displays the Payment Network ID (PNI id) and address details of the vendor. Use the PNI id to send an invitation to the vendor in the BILL network.

Send an invitation
In this cURL example, an invitation is sent to connect with the vendor in the BILL network. In the request, vendorId is set as the BILL-generated ID of the vendor called Happy you created in your BILL organization. Retrieve the vendorId with GET /v3/vendors.

Webhooks
Use the BILL webhooks to subscribe to and receive real time notifications for events, such as create a vendor, update a vendor, or create a payment. In addition, as a BILL partner, when you create a subscription for events, you get event notifications for all your created organizations.

❗️
IMPORTANT

A BILL partner can perform partner-level operations, which includes creating an organization, and then creating and managing users for that organization. See BILL partner operations for more information.

If you are interested in becoming a BILL partner, please reach out to your account manager for more information.

When you subscribe to BILL events, you provide a location URL for where you want to receive notifications. BILL sends a notification to that URL each time a subscribed event is triggered.

In the next set of sections, we walk through the rules for working with BILL webhooks. You can jump to Working with BILL webhooks to learn about examples for working with the webhooks API.

BILL webhook API general rules

BILL webhook API general rules
The BILL webhook API follows a set of rules.

Access rules
Design	Description
Sandbox base URL	https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect-events
Production base URL	https://gateway.prod.bill.com/connect-events
Security key	When you create a new subscription, a one-time securityKey is one of the generated values in the response. All event notifications sent to your notificationUrl are signed with this key using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. The key is sent as the x-bill-sha-signature header value in the notification.

You can use the security key to verify all notifications sent to you. It is good practice to keep the security key for your subscription updated in a timely manner. You can generate a new security key for your subscription with POST /v3/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/security-key.
Authentication rules
Both organization-level users and partner users can set up webhooks. Simply set the required header values in your webhook API requests and you have access to webhooks at the desired level.

Organization-level header values for webhooks	Partner-level header values for webhooks
sessionId: API session ID generated with /v3/login	sessionId: Partner API session ID generated with /v3/partner/login
devKey: Developer key sent to you by BILL when you create a developer account	appKey: Application key sent to you by BILL when you create a partner account
Header value for setting up subscriptions for Spend & Expense events
apiToken: Access token for Spend & Expense API authentication
Idempotent key rules
An API request is idempotent when the response shows the same result each time the same request is made.

Design	Description
Endpoints that require an idempotent key	Only two BILL webhook endpoints require an idempotent key.

- Create a subscription: POST /v3/subscriptions
- Create a security key: POST /v3/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/security-keyThis ensures that you do not accidentally create multiple subscriptions or security keys for the same set of events.
X-Idempotent-Key header value	The idempotent key is set as an additional X-Idempotent-Key header value. You must generate a new idempotent key for each new request.
Time To Live (TTL)	For an idempotent key used in an API request, the API response is cached for 24 hours.

For this duration, if your API request results in a successful response, and then you make another API request with the same X-Idempotent-Key header value, you will receive the cached response from your previous API request.

If your API request results in an error, and then you use the same X-Idempotent-Key header value with your fixed API request, you will continue to receive the cached error response from your previous API request. In this case, you must send a new X-Idempotent-Key header value with your fixed API request for a successful response.
UUID4 format	All your idempotent keys must be in the UUID4 format.

UUID4 is a randomly-generated 128-bit identifier. You can easily generate a value for your integration. For example, in Python, you can generate a UUID4 value with uuid.uuid4().
Errors	Incorrect usage of the idempotent key results in errors. See the next section for more information about idempotent key errors. When you receive an idempotent key error, fix the problem at your end and retry.
Idempotent key errors
Incorrect usage of the idempotent key results in errors.

Error	HTTP status
Missing idempotent key	400 Bad Request
Malformed idempotent key	400 Bad Request
The same idempotent key is used for different operations	409 Conflict
Additional requests are made with the same idempotent key when another request is in progress	429 Too Many Requests

BILL webhook API notification rules
Event notifications from the BILL webhook API follow a set of rules.

Design	Description
Notification URL	The notification URL is the location where you receive event notifications. The URL that you provide must be HTTPS.

Note: When you are testing with BILL webhooks, you can use an online service for setting up a notification URL. For example, public.requestbin.com.
All notifications are organization-specific	BILL sends you event notifications only for the BILL organization used to set up a subscription.

When you set up a subscription, the organizationId in the API response represents the BILL organization for which your subscription is created. See Working with BILL webhooks for more information.
Event notification id	BILL sends each event notification with a unique event id. Your integration must save event id value to avoid processing any duplicate notifications.
JSON escaped payload	When BILL sends you an event notification, the payload is JSON-escaped and is presented as a string.

Ensure that your integration handles JSON escaped payloads for notifications. See Working with BILL webhooks for more information about a sample payload.
Order of notifications	In case notifications are sent out of order, organize the notifications based on the timestamp of each notification.
Time To Live (TTL)	BILL maintains a 90-day event history for each subscription. You can get the list of event notifications sent to you for a subscription with GET /v3/events/subscription/{subscription_id}.
Notification retries	When BILL does not receive a HTTP 200 statusCode for an event notification within 10 seconds, the notification is considered a failure.

When an event notification fails, BILL tries to send the notification again with exponential backoff. When BILL does not receive a HTTP 200 statusCode after resending a notification five times, BILL sends the notification in a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) and handles notification retries at a later time.

To address any issues with notification retries, you can get the list of event notifications sent to you for a subscription with GET /v3/events/subscription/{subscription_id}.

Working with BILL webhooks
When you set up a subscription for your choice of BILL events, you receive real time event notifications when those events are triggered.

❗️
IMPORTANT

For organization-level users, BILL sends event notifications only for the BILL organization used to set up a subscription. When a subscription is set up, the organizationId in the API response represents the BILL organization for which the subscription is created.

When a partner user creates a subscription for events, BILL sends event notifications for all organizations created by the partner user.

Subscribe to BILL events
BILL provides a catalog of all events that you can subscribe to with GET /v3/events/catalog. See the /v3/events/catalog API for more information.

To create a subscription with POST /v3/subscriptions, set the required fields.

Field	Description
name	Subscription name
status	Subscription status information. Set enabled as true for keeping the subscription enabled. You can use the field to disable the subscription at a later time.

When an event notification fails, BILL tries to send the notification again with exponential backoff. When BILL does not receive a HTTP 200 statusCode after resending a notification even after exponential backoff, BILL sets the subscription enabled status as false and stops sending any notifications.

The enabled status stays as false until the problem is resolved at your end and until the enabled status is set as true again.
events	In the events array, add events that you can subscribe to.

- type: Event name
- version: Event versionYou can get the full catalog of all events that you can subscribe to with GET /v3/events/catalog.
notificationUrl	The location where you receive event notifications. The URL that you provide must be HTTPS.
📘
NOTE

To create a subscription at the partner level, simply set your partner sessionId (with /v3/partner/login) and appKey as the required header values. The base URL and body parameters in the POST /v3/subscriptions request are the same for partner users and organization users.

Sample request
In this cURL example, a subscription is created for the bill.created, bank.updated, and bill.archived events. The required X-Idempotent-Key, devKey, and sessionId header values are set. A notificationUrl is set as the location URL for you to receive event notifications when any of the subscribed events is triggered.

📘
NOTE

When you are testing with BILL webhooks, you can use an online service for setting up a notification URL. For example, public.requestbin.com.

cURL

curl --request POST \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect-events/v3/subscriptions' \

}'
Response
In the response, a BILL-generated subscription id is available. The organizationId represents the BILL organization for which your subscription is created. BILL sends you event notifications only for the BILL organization used to set up this subscription.

JSON

{
  "id": "{subscription_id}",
  "name": "Bill management",
  "organizationId": "{organization_id}",
  "status": {
    "enabled": true,
    "reason": "Notifications for bill-related events",
    "actor": "CLIENT"
  },
  "events": [{
    "type": "bill.created",
    "version": "1"
  },

  "createdTime": "2025-12-10T23:25:27.127+00:00",
  "securityKey": "{security_key}"
}
When you create a new subscription, a one-time securityKey is one of the generated values in the response. All event notifications sent to your notificationUrl are signed with this key using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. The key is sent as the x-bill-sha-signature header value in the notification.

📘
NOTE

You can use the security key to verify all notifications sent to you. It is good practice to keep the security key for your subscription updated in a timely manner. You can generate a new security key for your subscription with POST /v3/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/security-key.

See the /v3/subscriptions API for more information about the complete list of subscription operations.

Subscribe to Spend & Expense API events
When you are subscribing to the BILL Spend & Expense API events, your POST /v3/subscriptions API request must include the apiToken header value for authentication.

cURL

curl --request POST \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect-events/v3/subscriptions' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Idempotent-Key: {UUID4_key}' \
--header 'apiToken: {api_token}' \
--data '{
  "name": "Bill management",
  "status": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "events": [{
    "type": "spend.transaction.updated",
    "version": "1"
  }],
  "notificationUrl": "https://example.com/billmanagement"
}'
Generate a test subscription event
When you set up a subscription, you can generate a test event with POST /v3/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/test.

You can use this endpoint to confirm whether the your subscription and notifications workflow has been successfully set up. BILL sends you a test event notification to the specified subscription notificationUrl.

❗️
IMPORTANT

All the fields in the test event notification are test values. You cannot use any of the test values for any other operation.

Sample response
In this response example, a test event notification is available. The JSON-escaped payload is presented as a string.

JSON

{
    "id": "{event_id}",
    "type": "test",
    "version": "1",
    "subscriptionId": "{subscription_id}",
    "payload": "{\"metadata\":{\"eventId\":\"{event_id}\",
        \"subscriptionId\":\"{subscription_id}\",\"organizationId\":\"{organization_id}\",
        \"eventType\":\"test\",\"version\":\"1\"},

    "createdTime": "2025-12-15T23:15:27.127+00:00",
    "statusCode": 200
}
Get events for a subscription
You can get the list of event notifications sent to you for a subscription with GET /v3/events/subscription/{subscription_id}.

📘
NOTE

You can also resend a specific event with POST /v3/events/subscription/{subscriptionId}/event/{eventId}.

Sample response
In this response example, an array of event objects are available along with a BILL-generated event id. Each event object represents the notification that BILL sends to your notificationUrl when the event is triggered. The JSON-escaped payload of each event notification is presented as a string.

Search operations with lists
When you request a list of objects with the BILL API, you can perform a range of operations in your requests. This includes filtering, sorting, and pagination. In your GET request, add all search operations as query parameters.

Filter operation
Set the field name, operator, and value in your list filters as query parameters. Both simple and compound filtering is available.

The format is filters={field_01}:{op}:{value},{field_02}:{op}:{value}.

Operators
A range of operators are available for you to filter with. See Filterable fields for information about available fields and related operators.

Operator value	Name	Example
eq	Equal	filters=accountType:eq:BUSINESS
ne	Not equal	filters=billCurrency:ne:USD
gt	Greater than	filters=createdTime:gt:"2025-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"
gte	Greater than or equal	filters=updatedTime:gte:"2025-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"
lt	Less than	filters=createdTime:lt:"2025-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"
lte	Less than or equal	filters=updatedTime:lte:"2025-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"
in	In	filters=invoiceCurrency:in:"USD,CAD"
nin	Not in	filters=accountType:nin:"NONE,PERSON"
sw	Starts with	filters=name:sw:"Hap"
📘
NOTE

For filtering with createdTime and updatedTime, you can set a range of ISO 8601 date-time values.

yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSX
yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS
yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss
yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm
yyyy-MM-dd
Sample request
In this cURL example, the filter is set for all vendors created in September 2025. A compound filter is set with filters=createdTime:gte:"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",createdTime:lt:"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z".

cURL

curl --request GET \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/vendors?filters=createdTime:gte:"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",createdTime:lt:"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'devKey: {developer_key}' \
--header 'sessionId: {session_id}'
Sort operation
Set the field name and sort order as query parameters. You can sort in the ascending (asc) or descending (desc) order. The default sorting order is ascending. Both simple and compound sorting is available.

The format is sort={field_01}:{sort_order},{field_02}:{sort_order}.

📘
NOTE

Sorting occurs in the specified order.

Sorting examples	Description
sort=dueDate:asc	Sort by dueDate in the ascending order
sort=dueDate:desc	Sort by dueDate in the descending order
sort=dueDate,fundingAmount:desc	Sort by dueDate in the ascending order and fundingAmount in the descending order
See Sortable fields for information about fields you can sort with.

Sample request
In this cURL example, vendors are sorted by createdTime in the descending order.

cURL

curl --request GET \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/vendors?sort=createdTime:desc' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'devKey: {developer_key}' \
--header 'sessionId: {session_id}'
Pagination
When you perform a search, you get a maximum of 100 results with one API request. For example, you get a maximum of 100 bills with one GET /v3/bills request.

When your search response has over 100 results, the results are paginated. In this case, the response includes nextPage and prevPage values for you to navigate between the pages of results. The nextPage and prevPage values uniquely represent each page of results based on your search.

Sample request 01: Get first page of 5 results
In this cURL example, vendors are filtered by billCurrency and also sorted by createdTime in the descending order. In addition, the max query parameter is set as 5 to get 5 results per page.

The query parameters are set as filters=billCurrency:eq:USD&sort=createdTime:desc&max=5.

cURL

curl --request GET \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/vendors?filters=billCurrency:eq:USD&sort=createdTime:desc&max=5' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'devKey: {developer_key}' \
--header 'sessionId: {session_id}'
Response 01
In the response, the first 5 results are available. A nextPage value is available for you to get the next page of results in a subsequent request.

JSON

{
  "nextPage": "{nextPage_value}",
  "results": [
    {
      // result 01
    },
    
    ...
    
    {
      // result 05
    }
  ]
}
Sample request 02: Get next page of 5 results
In this cURL example, the next page of 5 results are requested. The page query parameter is set as the nextPage value from the previous response. Since nextPage value uniquely represents a page of results based on the search, do not set any filters and sort parameters.

📘
NOTE

You can change the max value in your subsequent request. For example, you can request a next page of 15 results with max=15.

The query parameters are set as ?page={nextPage_value}&max=5.

cURL

curl --request GET \
--url 'https://gateway.stage.bill.com/connect/v3/vendors?page={nextPage_value}&max=5' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'devKey: {developer_key}' \
--header 'sessionId: {session_id}'
Response 02
In the response, the next 5 results are available. Both nextPage and prevPage values are available for you to navigate between pages of results in a subsequent request.

JSON

{
  "nextPage": "{nextPage_value}",
  "prevPage": "{prevPage_value}",
  "results": [
    {
      // result 06

Documents and attachments
BILL enables you to upload documents for bills. In addition, you can upload supporting attachments for vendors, customers, and invoices. In this section, we explain uploading a vendor attachment and downloading a vendor attachment.

❗️
IMPORTANT

The vendor attachment, customer attachment, invoice attachment, and bill document API operations are similar. See the /v3/attachments and /v3/documents API for more information.

Upload a vendor attachment
In your POST /v3/attachments/vendors/{vendorId} request, set the required fields.

Field	Description
vendorId	BILL-generated ID of the vendor. The value begins with 009.
name	File name with extension. For example, to upload a PDF attachment titled business_details, set name as business_details.pdf.

BILL Developer Terms
These Developer Terms (“Agreement”) form a legal agreement between Bill.com, LLC., a Delaware corporation, and its affiliates (“BILL”), on the one hand, and you and any organization you identify in your registration with BILL (your “Organization”), on the other hand. You represent and warrant that you are of legal age and have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement on your own behalf and on behalf of your Organization. In this Agreement, “You” and “Your” refer collectively to you and your Organization. Your use of the BILL Service is conditioned upon your agreement to the terms of this Agreement.

BILL operates a service (located at www.bill.com) in which subscribers may engage in certain payment processing, invoicing and other cash flow management activities (the “BILL Service”). You offer or plan to offer one or more products or services which you have accurately described to BILL as part of the registration process in one or more of several partnership models offered by BILL and described in detail herein.

This Agreement addresses the following proprietary materials of BILL:

Development tools for integrating Your product or service with the BILL Service (together, the “Integrated Application”) such as implementation guides, applications, sample code, libraries, data, files and any updates to the foregoing that BILL makes available to You on its developer website (developer.bill.com) or otherwise (collectively, the “Developer Materials”) which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement;
BILL’s web services-based application programming interface to the BILL Service, as further described on the developer website and as modified by BILL from time to time in its sole discretion (the “BILL API”);
One or more BILL Service accounts for integration, development, and trial purposes only, and not for Your internal productive purposes (Your “Test Accounts”), and
Option to Participate in BILL’s Partner Program.
1. Organization API License Grant; Restrictions
For the duration and subject to the terms and conditions of the Developer Terms (including the Developer Materials) and this Agreement, BILL grants to You a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited, revocable license to copy and use the Developer Materials, the BILL API and the Test Accounts solely for the purpose of designing Integrated Applications to integrate with or share data between or otherwise communicate with the BILL Service through the BILL API in the manner described by You as part of the registration process.

You have no authority to distribute the BILL Service or make it available to customers, unless granted in a separate agreement between You and BILL.

3. API Key
BILL will assign You a unique identifier for each Integrated Application (the “Key”). To initiate a session with the BILL Service, the Integrated Application shall pass this Key together with the UserID and password of a valid, authorized BILL customer account, to the BILL API. You acknowledge and agree that this Key is the property of BILL, and that the misuse of this Key by You or a third party could cause substantial loss and damage to BILL and its customers. Accordingly, You will implement appropriate measures to protect the security of the Key and not provide the Key to any third party, and You will notify BILL promptly if You suspect it has been misappropriated or misused or lost or stolen or otherwise accessible to a third party without rights to use it.

4. Approval
You will obtain written approval from an authorized representative of BILL, which may be an email, before You sublicense or distribute the Integrated Application to customers. BILL will review the Integrated Application for merchantable quality and compliance with this Agreement at any time during the term. BILL will not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including without limitation lost business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a result of Your development of the Integrated Application regardless of whether BILL approves it. You will be solely responsible for assuring that the Integrated Application conforms to Your descriptions of the Integrated Application disclosed to BILL and specifications and documentation you provide to your users, is free of defects in design and operation, and complies with applicable laws and regulations.
