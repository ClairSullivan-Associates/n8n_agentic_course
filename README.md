This repository contains all the materials for the one day, hands-on course "Agentic AI with Orchestrated Workflows for Engineers," including lecture slides, activity instructions (ungraded), and challenge problems (graded).  It is recommended that you clone this repository to your local machine.

The course will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to Agentic AI (Module 0)
- Foundational Agentic Patterns with n8n (Module 1)
- Advanced Patterns & Custom API Integration (Module 2)
- LLM Evaluation with Braintrust (Module 3)

It is designed such that the learners are provided with a short lecture, then work through a series of activites to learn the material, and finally complete a series of challenges that will be scored as part of a team competition (scoring algorithm not part of this repo).

The onboarding instructions for all accounts that will be needed for this workshop can be found in the Module 0 `onboarding.md` document.

### General Approach to the Course

For each module, you will begin by individually working through a series of ungraded activities that will teach you the fundamental concepts and skills needed to complete the module challenges.  After completing the activities, you will work in teams to complete a series of graded challenges that will test your understanding and application of the material.  The team with the highest score at the end of the course will be declared the winner!

### Workshop Link

All team scoring will be handled through the workshop platform at [https://aiworkshop.dev.bill.com/](https://aiworkshop.dev.bill.com/)

### Previous Course

A previous course was run for Bill.com April-June, 2025 focusing on how to create basic GenAI applications on AWS with LangChain.  The repository for that course can be found [here](https://github.com/ClairSullivan-Associates/genai_foundations).
